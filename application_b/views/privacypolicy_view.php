        <p>This Policy does not govern Inbase&rsquo;s collection of information through any website, or by any other means, other than through this Website, or the collection of information by any parent, or subsidiaries of Inbase (&quot;Other Entities&quot;).</p>
        <p>Visitors are encouraged to read this Policy before using the Website. By using the Website, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Policy and the Terms and Conditions, available at Inbase-lifestyle.com.</p>

        <p>(i) Personal Information. You are not ordinarily required to register or provide Personal Information in order to access the Website, though certain functionalities such as a membership program, through which purchasers of products may receive discounts on online purchases, participating in any contests, etc., may require registration. Inbase collects Personal Information from you only when you voluntarily provide it to Inbase - for example, in contacting Inbase through the Website, filling in the form for applying for a vacancy or while requesting for a visit to the manufacturing plant of Inbase, or exploring business opportunities with Inbase, answering surveys and polls, entering contests, sweepstakes, raffles and similar promotions, signing up for email updates and announcements concerning the Inbase&rsquo;s products and special promotions, and purchasing the Inbase&rsquo;s merchandise.

This number is identified and logged automatically in the Inbase&rsquo;s server log files whenever you visit the Website, along with the time(s) of your visit(s) and the page(s) that you visited. IP addresses of all Visitors are used by the Inbase to calculate the Website usage levels, to help diagnose problems with the Website's servers, and to administer the Website. Inbase may also use IP addresses to communicate or to block access by Visitors who fail to comply with the Policy and/or the Terms and Conditions of Use of the Website.

If you do not want your information to be collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure to be followed, in most of the browsers, by the user that allows the user to delete existing cookies, automatically decline cookies, or to be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer of particular cookies to the user&rsquo;s computer system. You should note, however, that declining cookies may make it difficult or impossible for you to access certain portions of the Website.</p>
        <p>Pixel Tags.
