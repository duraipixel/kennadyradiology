      <p>Each order can be shipped only to a single address, which is specified at the time of payment for that order. If you wish to ship products to different addresses, you will need to place multiple orders.</p>
      <p>

We make our best effort to ensure that each item in your order is shipped out within 1 - 2 working days of the order date. However, in some cases it may take up to 3 or more working days during festivals, sales or when there are other mitigating circumstances. Our goal is complete a delivery within 5 to 7 business days.</p>
<p>

Orders are processed from Monday to Saturday. Orders placed on Sunday will be processed the next day.
