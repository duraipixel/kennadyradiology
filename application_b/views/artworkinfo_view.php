				  <p>If you do not have eps vectored artwork we suggest that unless you created your art in MSword, Print Shop or some other basic program, that you contact your business card / letterhead printer to see if they have a copy of a vectored format of your art. In most cases they will have it, and forward it to you via email.</p>
				  <p>If you created this art yourself, or have a fax or jpeg of the art, we can send this art to our outside graphic department and within 24 hours turn your art into a vectored format. The charge for this is $35. Please let our customer service person know you wish to do this, and please add 2 business days to the production of your item.</p>
				<p><b>Not providing us with the correct art format can delay your order</b>. Your order is not considered complete, and will not be turned in to the factory until we have your art in the correct format. Most orders do not go in to production until 5-7 business days after a paper proof has been approved by you. The ship date we give you at the time of your order may change based on receipt of good vectored artwork. <b>Production time does not begin until we receive a complete order.</b></p>
